# DEPRECATED humantorch 

> Redirect to the new [Scott Kosman CLI](https://github.com/humantorch/scottkosman-cli)

This package has been deprecated in favor of a much newer, better, sexier version at [@humantorch/scottkosman-cli](https://github.com/humantorch/scottkosman-cli).

## Usage

When you run `npx humantorch`, it will automatically redirect you to the new CLI:

```bash
$ npx humantorch
```

This will run `npx scottkosman` instead, giving you access to the latest and greatest Scott Kosman CLI experience.

## New CLI Features

The new `scottkosman` CLI includes:
- Interactive welcome experience with ASCII art
- Professional bio and background information
- Quick links menu to external URLs
- Modern TypeScript architecture
- Beautiful terminal styling

## Direct Usage

You can also run the new CLI directly:

```bash
$ npx scottkosman
```
